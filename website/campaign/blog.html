# I built an AI coding assistant that manages its own brain

Every AI coding tool has the same blind spot: the context window is invisible. The AI doesn't know what it's read, what it's forgotten, or how much room it has left. You end up re-pasting code and fighting an invisible limit.

I built [Context Pilot](https://github.com/bigmoostache/context-pilot) to fix this. It's a Rust TUI where every piece of context is a visible panel with a live token count. The AI sees its own memory as a sidebar and actively manages it.

## The result

I pointed it at its own 15K-line codebase. It opened 90+ files, annotated every one, closed them after reading, and ended at 14% context usage. It read everything and still had 86% of its budget free.

## How

47 tools. 14 modules. 5 LLM providers. Full git, GitHub CLI, tmux terminal integration. Persistent memories, todos, scratchpad. Autonomous mode with guard rails.

The AI opens what it needs, closes what it doesn't, takes notes, and archives old conversations. No manual context management.

**GitHub**: https://github.com/bigmoostache/context-pilot

AGPL-3.0. ~15K lines of Rust. Try it out.</div>
