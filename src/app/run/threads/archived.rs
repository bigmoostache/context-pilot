//! Live thread-archived emission for the main event loop.
//!
//! The `emit_thread_archived` function is a main-loop **observe-on-change
//! chokepoint**: it diffs each thread's live `archived` flag against the
//! per-thread snapshot held in [`BridgeState::thread_archived_memo`] and
//! emits a durable [`ThreadArchived`] / [`ThreadRestored`] delta only on an
//! actual change — capturing mutations from *every* source (web command, TUI
//! action, the `Send` tool's auto-unarchive) with one uniform path.
