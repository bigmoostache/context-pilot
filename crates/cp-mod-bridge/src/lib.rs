//! Agent-side orchestration bridge — the **entire** agent-side footprint.
//!
//! This module is **behaviorally inert when the bridge is OFF** (the default):
//! the agent reasons and acts identically whether or not this module is
//! registered.  When ON, it owns:
//!
//! - **Oplog** — append-only, `fdatasync`'d WAL for durable command effects,
//!   `rev` assignment, `seen`-marks, phase transitions, lifecycle, and cost.
//! - **Stream tee** — lock-free SPSC enqueue of each `StreamEvent`; dedicated
//!   publisher thread writes `stream.sock`.
//! - **Command intake** — bearer-auth'd, journal-then-ack, injected via the
//!   existing user-message entry (never the spine).
//! - **Heartbeat** — dedicated thread, aligned in-place write.
//!
//! The module does **not** touch `writer.rs` — tier-② persistence is unchanged.
//! See `docs/design-orchestration-backend.md` §11 / §24.
